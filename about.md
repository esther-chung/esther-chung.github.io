I am currently a student in [Sogang University](https://wwwe.sogang.ac.kr/wwwe/index_new.html) located in South Korea. 
I am majoring in [Economics](https://econeng.sogang.ac.kr/econeng/index_new.html) & [Big Data Science](https://bds.sogang.ac.kr/bds/index_new.html), 
trying to pursue a Master's Degree in Data Science in the United States.

This page is a place to take notes about the entire materials on what I am studying and focusing on(Python, R, C++, Machine Learning, Economics).
Also, I will post some personal Data Analytics projects I am recently working on.
