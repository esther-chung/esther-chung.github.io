<h1 id="headings">Conclusion</h1>

<h2>1. GDP per capita in 2009 and 2019 by country</h2>
<h3> 1) There is generally a positive relationship between GDP per capita in 2009 and 2019. </h3>   
The trend of the graph that goes upward is clearly indicated.    
<h3> 2) Comparison of GDP per capita in 2009 and 2019 </h3>   
<h4> Countries whose GDP per capita decreased compared to 10 years ago (2009) </h4>    
(Countries where the circle is colored pink)    
Norway, Japan, France, Italy, Spain, Greece     
<h4> Countries with a significant increase in GDP per capita compared to 10 years ago (2009)</h4>      
(Countries with relatively large circles)    
Ireland, Iceland, USA, Israel, New Zealand, Korea, etc.    
<h3> 3) Scale of GDP per capita </h3>     
<h4> Countries surveyed with significantly higher GDP per capita than other countries</h4>    
Luxembourg, Switzerland, Norway, Ireland    
<h4> Countries surveyed with significantly lower GDP per capita than other countries</h4>     
Mexico, Turkey, Chile, Poland, Hungary, Latvia    
      
<h3> Conclusion: </h3>   
Over the past 10 years, per capita GDP may increase or decrease for each country, and there are differences in the amount of increase and decrease.    
However, when one country's per capita GDP is compared to other countries, the ranking does not change sharply.    
Therefore, when the GDP per capita is compared by 10 years, it can be seen that the trend is generally stable.    
    
<h2>2. Changes in GDP per capita & total output from 1970 to 2019 of representative countries by continent</h2>    

<h3> 1) Countries' GDP ranking in the top 2 in the continent</h3>    
Europe: Switzerland, Luxembourg      
Asia: Japan, Israel      
North America: Canada, USA      
South America: Brazil, Chile      
Africa: South Africa      
Oceania: New Zealand, Australia      

<h3> 2) Time series data of GDP per capita</h3>    
- Two European countries have the highest GDP per capita except for the 1980s     
- Representative countries in Oceania, North America and Asia generally maintain the similar levels, and the two countries in North America generally show stable growth rates without significant declines and increases.       
- Countries in South America and Africa consistently recorded the lowest GDP per capita.      
- Until the 2000s, the levels of GDP per capita in South America and Africa were similar. However, Through the 2000s, the two countries in South America showed slightly higher growth rates than in Africa, and the level of GDP per capita is currently higher in South America than Africa.     

<h3> 3) Time series data of gross output (GDP)</h3>     
- The U.S. ranked first in total output from 1970 to 2019, and the gap with other countries grew rapidly over time.     
- After the United States, Japan, Brazil and Canada consistently ranked second, third and fourth in total output.     

<h3> Conclusion: </h3>  
When looking at the representative countries of each continent, GDP per capita and gross output do not show a direct positive relationship.     
In terms of gross output, the United States, Japan, Brazil, and Canada tend to show a high trend, while European countries look relatively low, but the per capita GDP is higher in European countries.     
National wealth is not directly related to the standard of living per capita.
