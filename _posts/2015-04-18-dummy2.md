<h2>1. Purpose of the Analysis</h2>
<p>Through the yearly data of each country's GDP and GDP per capita, 
we will conduct the comparative analysis on the following three topics.
1) Cross-section comparison of GDP per capita at any given time
2) A time series analysis of GDP per capita which represents the growth of a country
3) Analysis of whether there is a correlation between gross output and GDP per capita</p>

<h2>2. Values that we are looking for</h2>
<p>1) Growth Rate of GDP per capita from 1970 to 2019 (for each country)
2) Comparison of changes in GDP per capita of representative countries in each continent
3) Comparison of changes in total output of representative countries in each continent</p>
