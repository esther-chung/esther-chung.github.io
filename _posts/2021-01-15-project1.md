<h1 id="headings">Motivation</h1>
<h2>1. Purpose of the Analysis</h2>
<p>Through the yearly data of each country's GDP and GDP per capita, </p>
<p>we will conduct the comparative analysis on the following three topics.</p>
<p>1) Cross-section comparison of GDP per capita at any given time</p>
<p>2) A time series analysis of GDP per capita which represents the growth of a country</p>
<p>3) Analysis of whether there is a correlation between gross output and GDP per capita</p>

<p></p>
<h2>2. Values that we are looking for</h2>
<p>1) Growth Rate of GDP per capita from 1970 to 2019 (for each country)</p>
<p>2) Comparison of changes in GDP per capita of representative countries in each continent</p>
<p>3) Comparison of changes in total output of representative countries in each continent</p>
<p>What kind of questions can we answer? </p>
<p>  - Will countries with high gross output have higher per capita GDP?</p>
<p>  - Continent/country with high GDP per capita? Continent/country with high gross output?</p>

<h1 id="headings">Input Data</h1>

<h2>1. Economic Statistics System</h2>
I accessed the Bank of Korea Economic Statistics System website and downloaded the data on GDP and per capita GDP.
--> [Economic Statistics System](https://ecos.bok.or.kr/)

<h2>2. Data #1 : GDP per capita (1970 ~ 2019) </h2>

<h2>3. Data #2 : GDP (1970 ~ 2019) </h2>

<h1 id="headings">Analysis of the variables for Visualization</h1>
<h2>1. Time series visualization of Growth of GDP : Scatter Plot </h2>
Since we want to compare the changes in GDP per capita in 1970 and 2019 by country and compare the size of each change, 
we select a "Scatter Plot with different sized dots"
When using Scatter Plot, the size of GDP per capita of each country can be roughly compared at a glance through the location of the dots.

<p></p>
<h2>2. Data #1 : GDP per capita : line graph (1970 ~ 2019) </h2>
We will extract and compare all time series data of the two countries with the highest GDP per capita in each continent as of 2019.
Since we want to show the changes in total output and GDP per capita over a long period of time in different countries, 
we select a "line graph" which is suitable for comparing different continenets within the same time scale.
