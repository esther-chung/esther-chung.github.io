<h1>VI.	Keywords Analysis</h1>
<h2>A. Input Code </h2>
As we have seen in the previous analysis, "love" is a common of the lyrics in the famous songs of pop singers. 
Because they had similar genre characteristics, we were able to take a closer look at the commonalities. 
To compare and analyze the characteristics of male and female singers' lyrics, I used the method of calculating the chi-square residual of TDM. 
Therefore, in the keyword analysis, the lyrics of several singers were classified by gender.
The code below shows the process of dividing the names of singers by conditional sentences using "strsplit" and storing them in different vectors by gender.

The code below shows the process of making the lyrics of female and male singers to TDMs. 
The "merge" function was used in the process of storing data of female and male singers in the TDM.

Next is the code that was written to express the processed TDM as a comparison cloud.

<h2>B. Output </h2>
The figure below is a table in which the Chisquare residuals are sorted by female singer and by male singer. 
In addition the comparison cloud visually compares the characteristics the lyrics by gender.

When sorting by female singer, "boys" appeared at the top,
and when sorting by male singer, "girl", "she", and "her" appeared at the top. 
In addition, words such as "work", "music", and "face" were found in the female singer sort table, 
and words like "change", "lonely", "smile", and "world" were found in the male singer side.

<h2>C. Interpretation </h2>
Through the results of keyword analysis using chi square residuals, we could derive the keywords that appear in the lyrics of male and female singers.
Putting together the results shown above, there are words related to women such as “she” and “girl” as male singer's lyrics text keywords. 
In addition, since “lonely” appears as a keyword, we can say that there is a tendency to sing about stories that express loneliness. 

Also, negative expressions such as “no” and words such as “change” are found. 
This can be interpreted that there were many songs related to love and break-ups in the famous songs, and they usually expressed sad feelings.
On the other hand, the keywords appearing in the lyrics of female singers were words that refer to men, such as "boys," as opposed to male singers. 
In addition, as words related to music such as “music” and “dance” are distributed in the center of the comparison cloud, 
it can be interpreted that female singers tend to express their love for music a lot in songs. 
Also, the fact that the word “work” is arranged at the top suggests that the subject of “work” was frequently used in the music of female singers.
