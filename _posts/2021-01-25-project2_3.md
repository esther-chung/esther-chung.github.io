<h1>V.	Keywords Analysis</h1>
<h2>A. Input Code </h2>
As we have seen in the previous analysis, "love" is commonly seen in the lyrics of famous songs of pop singers. 
Because they had similar genre characteristics, we were able to take a closer look at the commonalities. 
To compare and analyze the characteristics of male and female singers' lyrics, I used the method of calculating the chi-square residual of TDM. 
Therefore, in the keyword analysis, the lyrics of several singers were classified by gender.
The code below shows the process of dividing the names of singers by conditional sentences using "strsplit" and storing them in different vectors by gender.

The code below shows the process of making the lyrics of female and male singers to TDMs. 
The "merge" function was used in the process of storing data of female and male singers in the TDM.

Next is the code that was written to express the processed TDM as a comparison cloud.

<h2>B. Output </h2>
The figure below is a table in which the Chisquare residuals are sorted by female singer and by male singer. 
In addition the comparison cloud visually compares the characteristics the lyrics by gender.

When sorting by female singer, "boys" appeared at the top,
and when sorting by male singer, "girl", "she", and "her" appeared at the top. 
In addition, words such as "work", "music", and "face" were found in the female singer sort table, 
and words like "change", "lonely", "smile", and "world" were found in the male singer side.

<h2>C. Interpretation </h2>
Through the results of keyword analysis using chi square residuals, we could derive the keywords that appear in the lyrics of male and female singers.
Putting together the results shown above, there are words related to women such as “she” and “girl” as male singer's lyrics text keywords. 
In addition, since “lonely” appears as a keyword, we can say that there is a tendency to sing about stories that express loneliness. 
Also, negative expressions such as “no” and words such as “change” are found. 
This can be interpreted that there were many songs related to love and break-ups in the famous songs, and they usually expressed sad feelings.


On the other hand, the keywords appearing in the lyrics of female singers were words that refer to men, such as "boys," as opposed to male singers. 
In addition, as words related to music such as “music” and “dance” are distributed in the center of the comparison cloud, 
it can be interpreted that female singers tend to express their love for music a lot in songs. 
Also, the fact that the word “work” is arranged at the top suggests that the subject of “work” was frequently used in the music of female singers.

<h1>VI. Exploratory Analysis</h1>
<h2>A. Input Code </h2>
Singers were classified by period as a method to examine each of the characteristic. 
Data on 1900's singers(Beatles, Michael Jackson and Britney Spears) are stored in GEN_1, 
three singers who debuted between 2003 and 2005 in GEN_2, 
and the remaining three who debuted after 2006 are stored in GEN_3. 
I used "substr" to convert the file names to singer's names.
If the singer's name falls within each period (using %in%), it is added to the appropriate variable.

After creating a table for all of the period within one TDM, 
I wrote a code to remove the stopwords using the stopword list file used in class. 
The vector for the stopword list was designated as STOP, and the rowname was saved in NEW_TDM by using the setdiff function, excluding the case where the rowname equals to a stopword.

The code written below is the code entered to execute correspondence analysis, a type of exploratory analysis.

<h2>C. Interpretation </h2>
An exploratory analysis was conducted to classify famous pop singers by period and examine the distributional characteristics of the words in lyrics. 
Looking at the results derived through the correspondence analysis, in the case of GEN_1 which represents the lyrics of singers in the 1900s as input values, words such as “hey”, “girl”, “oh”, and “world” appear close to the origin. 
In addition, words such as “bad” and “hold” are distributed around the GEN_1 coordinate. 
From this, it can be seen that singers in the 1900s used fillers such as "hey" and "oh" a lot. 
However, the possibility that a specific singer in the 1900s used those fillers a lot should not be excluded.    

In the case of GEN_2 coordinates, a set of singers who debuted in 2003 to 2005, words such as “life”, “feel”, “tonight”, and “boy” are found near the area. 
Also, unlike GEN_1, we can see the appearance of “na” and “yeah” as some filler words.    

There are words such as “baby”, “eyes”, “heart” and “love” in GEN_3 which is separated as the last era. 
It can be seen that the word “love” has been more intuitively expressed in the lyrics, and there are many references to body parts. 
Furthermore, abbreviations such as “wanna” and “gonna” can be found near the GEN_3 coordinate. 
The fact that the lyrics used in the most recent periods contain more abbreviations is because people have come to use them more generally.
