<h1>III. N-gram Analysis</h1>
<h2>A. Input Code </h2>

In N-gram analysis, I tried to analyze Bruno Mars' text file as a representative. 
The file was saved in a variable called BRUNO_NGRAM, converted into bi-gram, and then derived as an output in a table called bi.Freq along with the frequency. 
The frequency count is checked on the wordcloud as well. 
Also, using write.table, I displayed in a notepad as the file name bi.gram. The process is represented as the above input code.

The above figure is a code written to display the same file as a tri-gram. 
The wordcloud is created in the same way as the Bi-gram process above, and the table is printed on the notepad.


<h2>B. Output </h2>

The figure above is the result of the vocabulary frequency in Bruno Mars' lyrics calculated by using bi-gram and tri-gram. 
First of all, if you look at the Bi-gram, repeating some "filler words" such as “yeah yeah” and “oh oh” were placed in the 1st and 2nd place, 
and the pronouns for the first and second persons such as “I” and “you” followed by the verb “know” were the next. ("I know", "you know")
In addition, it is shown that words with pronouns attached to prepositions were frequently used. 

In the tri-gram, similarly to the bi-gram, repetitions such as “yeah yeah yeah” and “oh oh oh” were found with high frequency. 
In addition, words including verbs and nouns with clear meanings such as “for too long”, “funk you up”, “you better run”, “one shot for”, and “for my pain” were identified as well. 

<h2>C. Interpretation </h2>
Because lyrics are elements of songs, filler words are often used.
The filler words are seemed to be used as a way to fill the empty spaces of the beats.
Also, it may be Ian element that induces the audience's response and adds popularity.

Previous frequency analysis confirmed that first and second person pronouns were found a lot. 
Through bi-gram analysis, it was found that verbs such as “know” are often used together with the pronouns. 
Since there are many songs that contain stories about the speaker and the other person, it can be seen that words such as “know”, “tell, and “be”, which are verbs that can express their thoughts, are used together. 
As the tri-gram is a frequency table that analyzes three words, I could see personal characteristics of Bruno Mars. 
There were many expressions representing interactions with another person referred in the lyrics, such as “funk you up”, “the way you”, and “you make me”.

Since there are many phrases such as “be okay tomorrow”, “you better run”, “one shot for", it can be seen that there are many lyrics that instill hope in the other person. 
In addition, phrases such as “get messed up” and “for my pain” suggest that the dominating content of his lyrics was about mourning for one's own pain.

<h1>IV. Collocation Analysis</h1>
<h2>A. Input Code </h2>

<h3>1) Collocation Analysis Step 1: Co-occurence word Extraction</h3>
This is the code written to extract Co-occurence words. The word “you” is set as the node, and the "grep" function is used to extract the node from the variable called RIHANNA that loaded Rihanna's lyrics file. 
The span is set as 4 surrounding words of the node. 
Finally, the vocabulary in span is saved in the variable RIHANNA_crc.

<h3>2) Collocation Analysis Step 2: Creating Co-occurence Frequency Dataframe</h3>
To create the air frequency data frame, I first created a table called Freq.rihanna
Then, the W1, W2, W1W2 values used in class were stored in Freq.c by using the "for" statement.

<h3>3) Collocation Analysis Step 3: Calculating Co-occurence</h3>
Finally, the co-occurence is calculated by referring to the t.score and MI calculation formula. 
These values were saved as a dataframe called RIHANNA_COLL.

<h2>B. Output </h2>
<h3> 1) Sort by "T score" in descending order</h3>

<h3> 2) Sort by "MI" in descending order</h3>
