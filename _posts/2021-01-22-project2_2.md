<h1>III. N-gram Analysis</h1>
<h2>A. Input Code </h2>

In N-gram analysis, I tried to analyze Bruno Mars' text file as a representative. 
The file was saved in a variable called BRUNO_NGRAM, converted into bi-gram, and then derived as an output in a table called bi.Freq along with the frequency. 
The frequency count is checked on the wordcloud as well. 
Also, using write.table, I displayed in a notepad as the file name bi.gram. The process is represented as the above input code.

The above figure is a code written to display the same file as a tri-gram. 
The wordcloud is created in the same way as the Bi-gram process above, and the table is printed on the notepad.


<h2>B. Output </h2>

The figure above is the result of the calculation of the vocabulary frequency in Bruno Mars' lyrics through bi-gram and tri-gram. 
First of all, if you look at the Bi-gram, lyrics of repeating filler words such as “yeah yeah” and “oh oh” were placed in the 1st and 2nd place, 
and the pronouns for the first and second persons such as “I know” and “you know” Words followed by the verb “know” followed. 
In addition, it can be seen that words with pronouns attached to prepositions were frequently used. 

In the tri-gram, similarly to the bi-gram, repetitions such as “yeah yeah yeah” and “oh oh oh” were found in the higher frequency. 
In addition, words including verbs and nouns with clear meanings such as “for too long”, “funk you up”, “you better run”, “one shot for”, and “for my pain” were identified.
