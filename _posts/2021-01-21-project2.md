<h1>I. Introduction</h1>

<h2>A. Motivation</h2>
The lyrics used in famous songs of world-class pop singers are set as the text data and will be analyzed in this research.
By looking at the lyrics of the representative songs, you can find out the characteristics of the text contained for each singer. 
Pop singers, who were very popular, have influenced a lot of fans around the world as much as their reputation. 
I think one of the major factors that made their music so popular was the genuine lyrics included in the representative songs. 
The lyrics of the song either show the singer's identity or the compressed scene from the times. 
Therefore, lyrics have a cultural influence similar to that of 'poetry'. 
Therefore, by analyzing the text in the lyrics, I would like to examine the followings. 
> 1) what kind of story each singer have tried to express to the audience      
  2) what was the interest of the people at that time      
  3) why they were so popular     

<h2>B. Data</h2>
The data used for the [analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/poetry) contains lyrics of the representative songs sung by nine singers who were popular worldwide. 
The nine singers include Adele, Amy Winehouse, Beatles, Bieber, Britney Spears, Bruno Mars, Lady Gaga, Michael Jackson, and Rihanna. 
In the case of some singers, the numbers of songs they had were too large to be loaded in our appropriate capacity.
However, we included as many songs as possible to derive meaningful results.
