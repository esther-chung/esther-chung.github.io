<h1>I. Introduction</h1>

<h2>A. Motivation</h2>
The lyrics used in famous songs of world-class pop singers are set as the text data and will be analyzed in this research.
By looking at the lyrics of the representative songs, you can find out the characteristics of the text contained for each singer. 
Pop singers, who were very popular, have influenced a lot of fans around the world as much as their reputation. 
I think one of the major factors that made their music so popular was the genuine lyrics included in the representative songs. 
The lyrics of the song either show the singer's identity or the compressed scene from the times. 
Therefore, lyrics have a cultural influence similar to that of 'poetry'. 
Therefore, by analyzing the text in the lyrics, I would like to examine the followings. 
> 1) what kind of story each singer have tried to express to the audience      
  2) what was the interest of the people at that time      
  3) why they were so popular     

<h2>B. Data</h2>
The data used for the [analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/poetry) contains lyrics of the representative songs sung by nine singers who were popular worldwide. 
The nine singers include Adele, Amy Winehouse, Beatles, Bieber, Britney Spears, Bruno Mars, Lady Gaga, Michael Jackson, and Rihanna. 
In the case of some singers, the numbers of songs they had were too large to be loaded in our appropriate capacity.
However, we included as many songs as possible to derive meaningful results.

<h1>II. Frequency Analysis</h1>
<h2>A. Input Code </h2>

In the current directory where the text file is stored, the file for each singer has been loaded using list.file(). 
In some cases, the names of the singers are displayed inside square brackets, so values containing special symbols are omitted using the "gsub" function. 
By using the "Table" function, the frequency count of the vocabulary used in each text file is displayed in descending order. 
Also, I created a wordcloud for each frequency value dividing singers by gender.


<h2>B. Output </h2>

The output result is saved as a text file under the directory called "freq".

<h2>C. Wordcloud Output </h2>

When all 9 people were represented in different pictures, it was difficult to find the distinctive features because the words that appeared in common were very similar. Therefore, I chose a method of dividing singers by gender and selecting only two representative singers for comparison. 
The samples were selected as Adele and Amy Winehouse (female solo singers), 
and Bruno Mars and Michael Jackson (male solo singers). 
You can check the result through the wordcloud image below.

As can be seen in the figure, in all samples, first-person and second-person pronouns such as ‘you’ and ‘I’ occupy a high frequency in the lyrics. 
In addition, words related to love such as'love' are commonly found. 
In particular, in the lyrics of male solo singers, words such as ‘girl’ and ‘baby’ can also be found near the center.

<h2>D. Interpretation </h2>

The frequency output results of singers' lyrics can be analyzed by comparing them with the upper frequency words of BNC's written and spoken words. 
As a representative, I would like to take a closer look at Adele's high frequency words. 
If you compare Adele's lyrics and written/spoken high frequency words in parallel as shown below, 
words that do not belong to BNC's high frequency words but belong to Adele's high frequency words are “me”, “my”, “your”, “love”, “all”, and “when”. 
First-person and second-person pronouns are often used in song lyrics, and the word love is used frequently, which indicates that love-related stories are often used in lyrics. 
In addition, in the case of BNC, the article "the" is used more often than "I" and "you", 
but in the lyrics, it can be seen that the pronoun that refers to a person is used more often than "the". 
This phenomenon can be interpreted as a characteristic that appears because stories such as relationships between people tend to be dealt with more often than stories about objects or events in song lyrics.

On the other hand, when analyzing the characteristics shown in the drawings of male and female solo singers represented by wordcloud, 
words such as “girl” found in the wordcloud of male solo singers were not found in the wordcloud of female solo singers. 
It can be said that this phenomenon appears because the lyrics of male solo singers frequently refer to women when singing about love. 
Furthermore, it can be interpreted in the same context that “she” and “her” can be seen near the center in the wordcloud of male solo singers. 
In the wordcloud of female solo singers, a male pronoun such as “his” can be seen, but it was confirmed that it did not appear as prominently as in the wordcloud of male solo singers. 
In sum, the lyrics for love stories were used a lot regardless of the sex of the singer, and pronouns referring to the opposite sex appeared with high frequency, and this characteristic was more prominent in the songs of male singers.
