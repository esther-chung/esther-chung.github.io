<h1 id="headings">Conclusion</h1>

<h2>1. GDP per capita in 2009 and 2019 by country</h2>
1) There is generally a positive relationship between GDP per capita in 2009 and 2019.    
    The trend of the graph that goes upward is clearly indicated.    
2) Comparison of GDP per capita in 2009 and 2019    
    * Countries whose GDP per capita decreased compared to 10 years ago (2009)    
      (Countries where the circle is colored pink)    
      Norway, Japan, France, Italy, Spain, Greece     
    * Countries with a significant increase in GDP per capita compared to 10 years ago (2009)    
      (Countries with relatively large circles)    
      Ireland, Iceland, USA, Israel, New Zealand, Korea, etc.    
3) Scale of GDP per capita    
    * Countries surveyed with significantly higher GDP per capita than other countries    
      Luxembourg, Switzerland, Norway, Ireland    
    * Countries surveyed with significantly lower GDP per capita than other countries    
      Mexico, Turkey, Chile, Poland, Hungary, Latvia    
    
    Conclusion: Over the past 10 years, per capita GDP may increase or decrease for each country, and there are differences in the amount of increase and decrease.    
    However, when one country's per capita GDP is compared to other countries, the ranking does not change sharply.    
    Therefore, when the GDP per capita is compared by 10 years, it can be seen that the trend is generally stable.
