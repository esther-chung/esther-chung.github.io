<h1>00 Prologue</h1>
<h2>1. Corpus linguistics (= text mining)</h2>
The purpose is to derive meaningful information that is difficult to find with human intuition from corpus and text through quantitative/statistical analysis.     
It pursues to explore human language, experience, mind, and knowledge.     
     
<h2>2. Big Data and R</h2>
* Characteristics of Big Data     
Unorganized data: processing is required     
Large data: Statistical analysis is required     
     
* Data Science / Data Mining     
The study of extracting and delivering meaningful new hidden information     
Data collection, processing, analysis, transmission, and visualization     
Computer Science + Statistics + Information Utilization Academic Fields… (Python and R are the most used)     

* O’Reilly Media (2012)        
Data science is used in an integrated sense of various related disciplines, so it is difficult to have experts who are well versed in all fields.     
Most of them are conducted in teams, requiring interdisciplinary backgrounds in 2-3 fields.     
     
* The Big Data Era and Programming Language     
Unstructured data: the need for processing/organization     
Massive data: necessity of processing using computer     
Prediction and pattern exploration through modeling: The need for new analysis techniques and visualization analysis     
For data analysis,      
Table/sorted data is required, and unique input formats are required for each data analysis technique.     

<h2>3. R vs Python</h2>
* R     
Language developed by statisticians, well-established environment for data analysis     
Basic data structures and basic functions are for data analysis     
Advantages for visualization analysis     
Often used in academic fields where statistical analysis is essential     
     
* Python     
General purpose programming language     
Numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas modules require separate learning     
Data analysis is limited with basic data structures and basic functions     
Advantages for machine learning: Requires separate module learning for machine learning

<h1>01 Corpus Big Data</h1>
<h2>1. Statistics</h2>
* A study covering all aspects of data (measurement/observation results)     
* Statistics work: collection / processing / organization / analysis / interpretation / presentation / visualization     
* The beginning and core of traditional statistics is “sample”     
Sample representativeness: the key to “random sampling” rather than sample size     
     
* Basic sampling method     
-Contingency     
Simple random sampling (random number, lot …)     
Systematic sampling (only the first sample is randomly sampled, and then at a certain interval)     
Provides an equal opportunity for individuals to be included in the sample     
-Distribution consideration: stratified sampling     
Extraction by considering the distribution ratio of stratification/group constituting the population (use of contingency within stratification)     
Poll: Region/Occupation/Society/Age/Gender     
Corpus: genre/time/demographic distribution     
     
<h2>2. Corpus</h2>
* Computerized text text or audio data that may be subject to language research and have not yet been observed/measured     
     
* Corpus in a consensual/general sense     
Elaborate design and construction in consideration of representativeness, balance, and size for language research purposes     
Type: Genre, dialect, user characteristics, historical period, language learning/acquisition, language comparison, etc...     
Language analysis information: raw text, morpheme analysis, vocabulary meaning, syntax analysis, etc...     
     
* Corpus in a broad sense     
Computerized language materials that can be used for various purposes other than language research purposes     
Representativeness and balance do not have to be considered     
Web documents, Twitter, Facebook, computerized text…     
     
* Linguistic value     
Large-scale language data reflecting the language knowledge and language use characteristics of native speakers     
Artificial x, language material created by reflecting the actual communication context     
Correlation between frequency/familiarity effect/language expression in speaker's mind for verbal expressions where intuitive judgment is difficult     
Vocabulary, grammar, meaning, discourse, dialect, language education, sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics, historical linguistics…   
     
* Applied value     
Text reflects the interests/messages of the language/cultural community  Interests in the humanities and social sciences, engineering, and marketing     
Information retrieval  Fast and accurate storage, search, classification and calculation of text data using a computer     
Computational linguistics, machine learning  Probabilistic distribution information extraction/learning data of language expression     


<h2>3. Population and Sample</h2>
* Corpus design     
Considering the variability of genre, time, dialect, and user characteristics,     
Language use, characteristics of interest, or representativeness of the population (balance, size)     
Usually, only the corpus design takes 1 to 2 years (for observation of universality and variability)     
     
* Corpus as a sample: A sample extracted from the language-speaking population, a sample with reduced observation size, reflecting the characteristics of the population     
* Corpus as population: reference corpus, population for comparison with individual text characteristics     

<h2>4. Corpus example</h2>
<h3>1) Brown Corpus</h3>
Corpus built for the first time in the world (typical of corpus design)     
Proving the effectiveness of the corpus in English education and psychology related to the frequency of appearance of English vocabulary     
Sampling Method: Considering the U.S. Publication Rate Composition of Text Ratio by Genre     
Assign a serial number to text candidate text by genre and draw lots     
Stratified sampling + simple random sampling     

<h3>2) BNC</h3>
Corpus with 100 million vocabulary words targeting British Standard English     
90% octopus + 10% spoken     
Considering statistical distribution and social class distribution     
<h3>3) 21st Century Sejong Plan Corpus</h3>     
National task to build/disseminate Korean language resources and promote language information processing in an information-oriented society     
Modern Korean Basic Corpus     
Modern Korean Spoken Warrior Corpus     
Korean-English, Korean-Japanese parallel corpus, North Korean/overseas Korean corpus…     
 
<h2>5. Corpus Linguistics from a Language Resource Perspective</h2>
* Corpus linguistics orientation     
Data at scale beyond the limit of observation of individual researchers (Hidden Knowledge Discovery)     
Data reflecting the variability and universality of language use     
     
* Limitations of existing linguistic research     
Limited range (extraction of examples, limited statistical techniques)     
Excessive dependence of corpus tools (lack of diversity)     
Limited corpus format, lack of data processing ability, poor learning of various statistics     

<h2>6. Corpus Linguistics from Computational Linguistics Perspective</h2>
* Computational application centered on grammar theory (1950~1980)     
* Computational application using corpus (1990 ~)     
* State-led large-capacity corpus construction, language rules/pattern learning     
* Research on natural language processing systems that can be applied in practice     

<h2>7. Corpus Linguistics from Convergence Perspective</h2>
* Digital Humanities     
Convergence field of humanities and social sciences and computational research using digital resources     
(Data Analysis + Digital Resource Creation)     
     
* Cultural Somology     
Mostly use google Ngram Viewer     
     
* Data Science     
The study of extracting meaningful new information that was hidden from big data     
Data Engineering, Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Engineering, Visualization, Hackers, Information Utilization     
Statistics is the grammar of data science     
     
* 21st century philology     
Philology's Direction: To study the historical archetypes and meanings through historical records     
The direction of the big data environment: “human” in most cases     
The need for interdisciplinary research  Requires interest and empathy in various disciplines
